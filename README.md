# MIX_Project

<b><u>Description:</b></u>

Fight Club is intended to make use of AR through a 2-player battle played with a specially printed deck and a smartphone mobile app. The game’s idea is simple: a virtual fight between your little “pet” and your opponent’s.
The deck consists of currently 2 cards available, each with its own dragon image. The aim of the game is to be the last player with a dragon alive.
To start the game, the mobile app must be launched and press the “Battle” button. The phone’s camera will be launched, and the players may begin battling. The first player places a card facing up where its caged animal will come to life, after which the second player may repeat the same action.
In order to start battling, the players will push their cards forward. At which point the dragons will starts fighting. Once the health bar of any of the battling dragons has reached zero, the dragon will die, and will be declared the loser.
